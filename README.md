- 👋 Hi, I’m Swarnim!
- 🌱 I'm a software developer by profession and a geek for all kinds of technologies.
- 🌅 At work I mostly program in languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript and Python and thus have experience in frameworks such as React, ExpressJS, Flask, FastAPI and so on.
- 🏌️ In my free time I like to program in Go and explore uncharted territories.
- 🧙🏼‍♂️ I mostly use Vim or Emacs as my dev environment and Arch Linux as my Operating System.
